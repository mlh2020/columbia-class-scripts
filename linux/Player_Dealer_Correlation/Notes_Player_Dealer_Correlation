I believe we've found the culprits conspiring to defraud Lucky Duck. It's a team of one player(Mylie Schmidt) and one dealer(Billy Jones).
I've come to this conclusion based on the fact that Mylie was present for every game that resulted in a major loss and that Billy Jones was the
dealer for 12 out of 13 of the major games lost.
